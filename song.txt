Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield

Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back

Oden's sons           //feature
Attack!
Unleash hell! Do not repent!

Warfare grants us no lament  //one more feature
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
